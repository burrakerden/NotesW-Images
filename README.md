# NotesW-Images
Main goal of this application will be to select photos from the gallery and save them to core data with notes.
I used core data properly and combined it with some features.


* In this application, you can take an image from the photo gallery and save it with 3 different notes. You can think of it like a shopping list app, but the last option, price, only accepts integers.
* You can also click on the collection cell and edit the item you saved to the core data. And again, you can click the "-" button on the cell and delete the product you registered from the core data (I used protocol for this feature).
* Also note the position of the keyboard when the texfield is clicked. will position the textfield above the keyboard.


## Features
* MVVM Design Pattern
* XIB
* UICollectionView
* Bar Button
* Protocols
* UIImagePickerController
* UITapGestureRecognizer
* UIAlertController
